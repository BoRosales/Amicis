### MVP USER FLOW ###
Upon landing on Amicis, the user must create or login to their existing account.  From there, the user will decide to choose a service or provide a service.  If the user chooses to provide a service they may choose a service from a drop down window or enter a new service.  Service providers may also choose to check their calendars for existing user scheduled events. 
If the user is seeking a service, they many choose from a drop down list of available vendors, then schedule through the calendar function.  
Both service providers and service seekers will be able to see previous services from their account login screens. 

### NICE TO HAVE ###
+ Service providers may sync their Amicis calendar with their Google calendar. 
+ Service seekers could recieve recommendations for future services based upon past services. 
+ Service seekers and service providers could receive ratings based upon their experiences. 
+ Background checks for service providers. 
+ Service seekers may suggest a service needed.
